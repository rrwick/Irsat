[Mapping]

# Here is where you specify the commands for Bowtie 2 read mapping.  Separate
# commands are used for paired-end reads and unpaired reads.

# The following values in all caps are variables that will be replaced by the
# program:
#   INDEX = the location of the Bowtie 2 index
#   PAIRED_READS_FILE_1 = a FASTG file of the first read in each pair
#   PAIRED_READS_FILE_2 = a FASTG file of the second read in each pair
#   UNPAIRED_READS_FILE = a FASTG file of unpaired reads

paired reads: bowtie2 -p 4 --local -x INDEX -1 PAIRED_READS_FILE_1 -2 PAIRED_READS_FILE_2

unpaired reads: bowtie2 -p 4 --local -x INDEX -U UNPAIRED_READS_FILE




[Assembly]

# Here is where you specify the commands for assembly.

# Separate commands are given for three different scenarios: assembling paired
# reads, unpaired reads and a combination of paired and unpaired reads.

# Some assemblers, such as Velvet, use multiple steps and you can therefore
# use multiple lines.  Each separate line will be executed separately.

# The following values in all caps are variables that will be replaced by the
# program:
#   PAIRED_READS_FILE_1 = a FASTG file of the first read in each pair
#   PAIRED_READS_FILE_2 = a FASTG file of the second read in each pair
#   UNPAIRED_READS_FILE = a FASTG file of unpaired reads
#   DIRECTORY = the directory that will contain the assembly output

paired reads: spades.py --only-assembler --pe1-1 PAIRED_READS_FILE_1 --pe1-2 PAIRED_READS_FILE_2 -o DIRECTORY

unpaired reads: spades.py --only-assembler --pe1-s UNPAIRED_READS_FILE -o DIRECTORY

both: spades.py --only-assembler --pe1-1 PAIRED_READS_FILE_1 --pe1-2 PAIRED_READS_FILE_2 --pe1-s UNPAIRED_READS_FILE -o DIRECTORY

# It is also necessary to specify the filename and location of the assembler's
# final contigs file, relative to the directory where the assembly is run.

contigs: contigs.fasta
